# personal-website

This is a repo for my [personal website](https://chad-johnston.com), hosted on AWS S3 with infrastructure built with OpenTofu. It uses [Bulma CSS](https://bulma.io/), [React](https://react.dev/) and [JSON resumes](https://jsonresume.org/) along with other AWS services (Route53, CloudFront, API Gateway, Lambda, IAM). File pushes to S3 and CloudFront Invalidations are automated via Github Actions pipeline.
